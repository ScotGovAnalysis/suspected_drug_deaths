## 1. Background

The Scottish Government has a National Mission to reduce drug deaths and improve the lives of those affected by drugs. This quarterly report presents Police Scotland management information to provide an indication of current trends in drug deaths in Scotland.

## 2. Summary

There were `r latest_fig` suspected drug deaths recorded between `r first_month` and `r last_month` `r year`. This is `r latest_fig_prevQ_prop`% (`r latest_fig_diff`) `r latest_fig_which` than between `r latest_fig_calendarQ` (`r latest_fig_prevQ`). Figure 1 shows that the rolling 12-month suspected drug death total has declined for five consecutive quarters, but still remains high.

**Note** that numbers of suspected drug deaths fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Care should be taken not to interpret movements between individual calendar quarters as indicative of any long term trend.

## 3. Main points

Between January and `r last_month` `r year`:

  * There were `r latest_3Q` suspected drug deaths, `r latest_3Q_comparison_prop`% (`r latest_3Q_comparison_diff`) `r latest_which2` than during the same period of `r year_prev`;
  * Males accounted for `r Males_latest`% of suspected drug deaths. This compares with `r Males_prev`% between January and `r last_month` `r year_prev`;
  * There were `r Females` suspected drug deaths of females, a decrease of `r Females_prop`% (`r Females_prev`) compared to the same period in `r year_prev`;
  * A majority (`r Age_prop_middleaged`%) of suspected drug deaths were of people aged between 35 and 54. This is broadly in line with previous quarters;
  * There were `r Age_young` suspected drug deaths in the under 25 age group, `r Age_young_prop`% (`r Age_young_comparison`) `r Age_which` than between January and `r last_month` `r year_prev`;
  * The Police Divisions with the greatest number of suspected drug deaths were: `r Ranking_PoliceDiv`.

Overall, there were `r rolling12months` suspected drug deaths over the 12 months to `r last_month` `r year`, `r rolling12months_propchange`% (`r rolling12months_absolutechange`) `r rolling12months_which` than the 12 months to `r last_month` `r year_prev`. More detail on the statistics presented above is available in the workbook provided here [ADD HYPERLINK].


## 4. Methodology

The data in this report is operational information from Police Scotland who compile figures on the basis of reports from police officers attending scenes of death. This is management information and not subject to the same level of validation and quality assurance as Official Statistics. National Statistics on drug deaths in Scotland are published annually by [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/deaths/drug-related-deaths-in-scotland/2021). More information on definitions, data sources, methodology and interpretation of the data, including the historical relationship between suspected drug death figures and drug misuse death statistics, can be found in the Methodology Annex[LINK].

## 5. Next update

The next ‘Suspected drug deaths in Scotland’ quarterly report will be published in December 2022, reporting on deaths up to September 2022.

The next annual drug misuse deaths publication from NRS is due to be released in Summer 2023.
