## 1. Background

The Scottish Government has a National Mission to reduce drug deaths and improve the lives of those affected by drugs. This quarterly report presents Police Scotland management information to provide an indication of current trends in suspected drug deaths in Scotland.

## 2. Summary

There were `r latest_4Q` suspected drug deaths between January and `r last_month` `r year`. This was `r latest_4Q_comparison_prop`% (`r latest_4Q_comparison_diff`) `r latest_which` than during the same period of `r year_prev` (`r latest_4Q_comparison`). After a downward trend in the rolling 12-month suspected drug death total since early 2021, suspected drug deaths increased in the most recent quarter. There were `r latest_fig` suspected drug deaths recorded over `r Quarter`,`r latest_fig_prevQ_prop`% (`r latest_fig_diff`) `r latest_fig_which` than the previous calendar quarter (`r latest_fig_prevQ`).

During `r year`:

  * There were `r latest_4Q` suspected drug deaths, `r latest_4Q_comparison_prop`% (`r latest_4Q_comparison_diff`) `r latest_which` than during the same period of `r year_prev`.
  * Males accounted for `r Males_latest`% of suspected drug deaths. This compares with `r Males_prev`% between January and `r last_month` `r year_prev`;
  * There were `r Females` suspected drug deaths of females, a decrease of `r Females_prop`% (`r Females_prev`) compared to the same period in `r year_prev`;
  * A majority (`r Age_prop_middleaged`%) of suspected drug deaths were of people aged between 35 and 54. This is broadly in line with previous periods;
  * There were `r Age_young` suspected drug deaths in the under 25 age group, `r Age_young_prop`% (`r Age_young_comparison`) `r Age_which` than between January and `r last_month` `r year_prev`;
  * The Police Divisions with the greatest number of suspected drug deaths were: `r Ranking_PoliceDiv`.
  
For quarter 4, `r Quarter`:

  * There were `r latest_fig` suspected drug deaths recorded, `r latest_fig_prevQ_prop`% (`r latest_fig_diff`) `r latest_fig_which` than between `r latest_fig_calendarQ` (`r latest_fig_prevQ`), and `r propdifference_same_quarter_prev_year`% (`r difference_same_quarter_prev_year`) `r latest_fig_which` than the same calendar quarter in the previous year (`r first_month` to `r last_month` `r year_prev`; `r figure_same_quarter_prev_year`).
  * This is the highest recorded number of suspected drug deaths recorded in a single calendar quarter since April to June 2021.
  
  **Note that numbers of suspected drug deaths fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Care should be taken not to interpret movements between individual calendar quarters as indicative of any long term trend.**

## 4. Methodology

The data in this report is operational information from Police Scotland who compile figures on the basis of reports from police officers attending scenes of death. This is management information and not subject to the same level of validation and quality assurance as Official Statistics. National Statistics on drug deaths in Scotland are published annually by [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/statistics-and-data/statistics/statistics-by-theme/vital-events/deaths/drug-related-deaths-in-scotland/2021). 

More information on definitions, data sources, methodology and interpretation of the data, including the historical relationship between suspected drug death figures and drug misuse death statistics, can be found in the Methodology Annex[LINK].

## 5. Next update

The next ‘Suspected drug deaths in Scotland’ quarterly report is due to be published in June 2023, reporting on deaths up to March 2023.

The next RADAR report, containing more up-to-date suspected drug death figures, will be publisehd in April 2023.

Public Health Scotland (PHS) compile a [Rapid Action Drug Alerts and Response (RADAR) Quarterly report](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/rapid-action-drug-alerts-and-response-radar-quarterly-report/rapid-action-drug-alerts-and-response-radar-quarterly-report-january-2023/#section-2) of drug-related indicators in order to inform action to prevent drug harms and deaths. In January 2023, PHS added suspected drug deaths to their set of RADAR indicators, presenting weekly data on suspected drug deaths from Police Scotland. PHS will now publish data on this indicator quarterly, with the next publication due for release in April 2023. In light of this, Scottish Government, together with partners, will consider the future of the ‘Suspected drug deaths in Scotland’ report.

The next annual drug misuse deaths National Statistics publication from NRS is due to be released in Summer 2023.
